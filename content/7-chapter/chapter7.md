# Chapter 7: Use Case: Tracer update
## Researcher's voice

This project involves a researcher working at an UMC exploring tracer uptake in patients with cancer (retrospective)
This project will generate: 
  - quantitative parameters on scans 
  - tracer outcome


## Data perspective


### Data collection

In this project, the research team expects to collect the following types of data:

  - pseudonymised data
  - medical history (EPD)
  - Patient characteristics
  - Imaging data


### Ethics perspective

According to the Wet medischp-wetenschappelijke onderzoek met mensen act (WMO), this project does medical research involving humans, therefore, needs to be assessed by an accredited METC in advance (before collecting data). _Quick comment for Judith Brands: Could you check if this explanation is ok?_
